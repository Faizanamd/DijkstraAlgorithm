# DijkstraAlgorithm
The given code implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.

The code reads input from the user using the Scanner class to obtain the number of vertices (n), the number of edges (e), and the adjacency matrix representing the graph.

The Dijkstra's algorithm is then applied to the graph represented by the adjacency matrix. It calculates the shortest distance from a source vertex (0) to all other vertices in the graph.

Finally, the code prints the distance values for all vertices, where each line displays the vertex index followed by its corresponding shortest distance from the source vertex
